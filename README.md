# Enshrouded Backup Manager
This is a simple utility that allows you to quickly back up and restore saved character and world files.

## How it works
By default, Steam Cloud Saves are turned on. The default values on startup assume that Steam Cloud is off. `C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME\Saved Games\Enshrouded`

The app will load with these paths set, with the world files defaulting to the files based on Slot 1

## Dangers
**You must be absolutely sure you are pressing the correct button when backing up and restoring files. If you back up a file 10 hours ago, and reload it, any progress since then will be overwritten. Be careful! It's very easy to click the wrong button at the wrong time.**

**I take no responsibility for your actions when using this tool.**

## Where are my saved Files?
If you have Steam cloud saves ON (This is the default), your files will be in: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\YOUR_USER_ID\1203620\remote`

If you want to manage your files locally (recommended).
Go to Steam > Library > Enshrouded > Properties > General > Then toggle Steam Cloud off

If you have turned Steam Cloud OFF
Your files will be in: `C:/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Saved Games/Enshrouded`
