# Enshrouded Backup Manager
This is a simple utility that allows you to quickly back up and restore saved character and world files.
By default the paths to these files are in `C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME\Saved Games\Enshrouded`

The app will load with these paths set, with the world files default to the files based on Slot 1

## Dangers
**You must be absolutely sure you are pressing the correct button when backingup and restoring files. If you backup a file 10 hours ago, and reload it, you will lose progress.**

**I take no responsiblity for your actions when using this tool.**
